## Context: Marco Polo 360 Development Handoff

You are taking over development of **Marco Polo 360**, a sophisticated peer-to-peer luggage sharing marketplace. The previous AI developer completed Phase 1.1 and you need to continue with Phase 1.2.

### 📋 Quick Project Summary
- **GitHub Repo**: https://github.com/Yotabbarzan/marco-polo  
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, Neon PostgreSQL
- **Deployment**: Vercel (auto-deploys from main branch)
- **Current Status**: UI complete and deployed, authentication temporarily disabled

### 🎯 What's Already Done ✅
1. **Complete Infrastructure Setup**: Next.js project with all dependencies
2. **Comprehensive Database Schema**: Prisma schema covering all marketplace features
3. **Beautiful Authentication UI**: Login, register, and email verification pages
4. **Vercel Deployment**: Working perfectly with auto-deployment
5. **UI Component Library**: shadcn/ui fully configured
6. **Responsive Design**: All pages work on mobile/desktop

### ⚠️ Current Issue Blocking Progress
**NextAuth authentication was temporarily disabled** due to build compatibility issues. The UI forms work perfectly but don't process authentication yet.

### 🚀 Your Immediate Mission (Phase 1.2)

**PRIMARY GOAL**: Restore and complete the authentication system

**Tasks to Complete**:
1. **Fix Authentication Setup**
   - Install/configure NextAuth v5 OR implement alternative auth solution
   - Create `/api/auth/register` endpoint 
   - Create `/api/auth/verify-email` endpoint
   - Add session management back to layout

2. **Database Connection**
   - Configure DATABASE_URL environment variable in Vercel
   - Run Prisma migrations: `npx prisma migrate dev`
   - Test database connectivity

3. **Complete Auth Flow**
   - Make registration form functional (currently just UI)
   - Implement 6-digit email verification system
   - Make login form authenticate users
   - Add password reset functionality

4. **Testing & Validation**
   - Test complete user registration → verification → login flow
   - Ensure all form validation works
   - Test error handling and edge cases
   - Verify responsive design still works

### 📂 Key Files You Need to Know
- `HANDOFF-STATUS.md` - Detailed status of what's done
- `development-plan-updated.md` - Complete roadmap 
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema (ready to use)
- `src/app/auth/` - Authentication UI pages (working)
- `.env` - Environment variables template

### 🎨 What You Can Test Right Now
Visit the Vercel URL and test these pages:
- `/auth/login` - Login form with validation
- `/auth/register` - Registration with password confirmation  
- `/auth/verify-email` - 6-digit verification interface
- `/` - Original MVP demo

All UI works perfectly - you just need to make it functional.

### 🔧 Environment Variables Needed
Configure these in Vercel for the authentication to work:
```
DATABASE_URL="your-neon-connection-string"
NEXTAUTH_URL="your-vercel-domain" 
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="random-secret-key"
```

### 📈 Success Criteria for Your Phase
- [ ] User can register account successfully
- [ ] Email verification works with 6-digit codes
- [ ] User can login and maintain session  
- [ ] Password reset flow functional
- [ ] All forms validate and handle errors gracefully
- [ ] Database operations work in production

### 🚨 Important Notes
1. **Don't recreate the UI** - it's already perfect and deployed
2. **The database schema is complete** - don't modify it
3. **Use the existing form validation patterns** - they're already implemented
4. **Follow the established file structure** - it's well organized
5. **The build process works perfectly** - don't change deployment setup

### 📋 After You Complete Phase 1.2
Continue with Phase 2 (Core Marketplace - Posts & Listings) as outlined in `development-plan-updated.md`. The foundation is solid, you just need to make authentication work.

**Previous developer's final note**: The hardest parts (UI design, database schema, deployment setup) are done. You're inheriting a well-structured project that just needs the authentication connected. The UI is beautiful and the architecture is solid. Good luck! 🚀
