## üö® CRITICAL SETUP INSTRUCTIONS FOR NEXT AI

### **First Steps When Starting**
1. **Verify Current State**
   ```bash
   cd "/path/to/marco-polo"
   npm run build  # Should build successfully
   git status     # Should show clean working directory
   git log --oneline -5  # Check recent commits
   ```

2. **Test Authentication System**
   - Visit deployed Vercel URL
   - Test registration at `/auth/register`
   - Test login at `/auth/login`  
   - Verify dashboard access at `/dashboard`
   - Confirm logout functionality

3. **Review Database Schema**
   ```bash
   cat prisma/schema.prisma  # Review TravellerPost and SenderPost models
   ```

4. **Check Environment Variables**
   - Verify Vercel environment variables are set
   - Confirm DATABASE_URL is connected to Neon
   - Test database connectivity

### **Development Guidelines**
- **ALWAYS** use the TodoWrite tool for task management
- **NEVER** modify the authentication system (it's working perfectly)
- **FOLLOW** the established patterns in `src/app/auth/` for new pages
- **USE** existing shadcn/ui components and styling patterns
- **TEST** locally before pushing to avoid deployment issues

### **Phase 2 Starting Point**
Begin with implementing the TravellerPost creation form:
1. Create `/src/app/posts/traveller/new/page.tsx`
2. Create `/src/app/api/posts/traveller/route.ts` 
3. Use existing form patterns from auth pages
4. Follow the established authentication guard patterns

4. Live site updates automatically

**Manual Testing:**
- Always test locally first with `npm run build`
- Push to GitHub for automatic Vercel deployment
- Test on live Vercel URL after deployment

## üìù FINAL NOTES

**What's Working Perfectly:**
- Authentication system is production-ready
- Database schema is comprehensive and ready
- UI foundation is solid with established patterns
- Deployment pipeline is reliable

**Focus Areas for Phase 2:**
- Implement marketplace post creation and browsing
- Add search and discovery features
- Build on existing authentication patterns
- Maintain code quality and user experience standards

**The foundation is solid - now build the marketplace features that make Marco Polo 360 functional for users to share luggage space and send items worldwide.**
