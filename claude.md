# Claude AI Development Guidelines

## Core Methodology

### 1. Todo List Management
- **ALWAYS** create a todo list using the TodoWrite tool for any task with multiple steps
- Break down tasks into the smallest feasible sub-steps
- Update todo status in real-time as work progresses:
  - Mark tasks as `in_progress` when starting
  - Mark tasks as `completed` immediately upon completion
  - Add new todos as requirements are discovered

### 2. Documentation and Learning
- After completing each step and sub-step, update relevant documentation
- Record what was accomplished and what was learned
- Maintain clear progress tracking throughout the development process

### 3. Planning and Thinking
- **THINK BEFORE ANY ACTION**: Analyze the entire problem thoroughly
- Plan comprehensively before taking any implementation steps
- Consider all implications and dependencies before proceeding
- Use systematic problem-solving approach

### 4. Deployment Workflow
- When code is ready to be pushed to GitHub, notify the user immediately
- User will deploy and test on Versailles environment
- User will report back with test results
- **STOP POINT**: Development is considered complete for that iteration when code is pushed to GitHub

### 5. Financial Boundaries
- Always stop at the point of money-related decisions or implementations
- Deliver completed work to GitHub when reaching natural stopping points
- Wait for user testing and feedback before proceeding with next iteration

## Implementation Rules
- Follow these guidelines precisely for all coding and development tasks
- Maintain systematic approach to problem-solving
- Ensure clear communication about progress and completion status
- Respect deployment workflow and stopping points
